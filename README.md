Easily Customizable Parkour "Game" Made Using Matter.js
 
Even after countless of attempts to make this work on mobile devices. It just doesn't work. Currently only working on computers or devices with similar mouse controls as computers.

The map is basically non-existent.

Controls:
  - Click on a random location, and you can hold it (kind of like the controls for Angry Birds). Nothing will happen if you let go above the starting position of the cursor.
  - The further you drag away from the origin, the more power force is applied to the cube.
  - You can only move when in contact with a platform.
  - If you fall, you will just keep falling. No death system lmao.
